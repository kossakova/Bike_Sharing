In this project we analyzed Citi Bike data from 2019 of New York Citi. The purpose of this analysis is to present visualized analysis that we made using Tableau for potential investors to launch bike share business in city of Des Moines.

*Resources*
* -Tableau Public 2021.3*
* -Python 3.7.10*
* - Pandas Library*

Since mechanics of making business work is quite different in a small city than in New York City, we first made visualized New York City to understand how bike- sharing business works, then we apply our knowledge and presented visualization to potential investors. 
Here is out story in Tableau that consist of 4 dashboards and 10 worksheets. 
Overview of the analysis
We picked the month of August for a good reason; August is one of the busiest times of the year of bike- sharing business. Our firs page of story answers 3 main questions. First, there were total records of 2,344,224 million rides in a month of August. 65 % of riders were male, 25% female and 10% unknown. Lastly, we determined that 80% of riders were subscribed customers.

Peak Overview

This page of our story will help us see average trips count.  Three bar charts represent peak hours, days of the week and days of the month as well as the customer/ subscriber ratio. 
Slowest times are between 12 am – 5 am, Wednesdays and Sundays.
The busiest 7 am, between 4- 7 pm on Thursdays thru Saturdays.

Trip Heatmaps
Heatmaps page of story as equivalent to peak overview but this one also has a breakdown of gender rides.  Just like the previous story page it shows us similar peak hours and days, additionally, male rides are significantly higher than females due to gender ratio

Checkout Times
Following line charts shows us number of bikes used in 60 minutes.  As we can see most of the bike’s rides did not exceed 50 minutes, the significant amount returned in first 30 min, that gives us a good idea of average ride time. Also, we provide similar line chart with additional gender breakdown.
