## Results

Since mechanics of making business work is quite different in a small city than in New York City, we first made visualized New York City to understand how bike- sharing business works, then we apply our knowledge and presented visualization to potential investors. 
Here is out story in Tableau that consist of **4** dashboards and **10** worksheets. 

### Overview of the analysis
We picked the month of August for a good reason; August is one of the busiest times of the year of bike- sharing business. Our firs page of story answers 3 main questions. First, there were total records of **2,344,224** million rides in a month of August. **65** % of riders were male, **25**% female and **10**% unknown. Lastly, we determined that morethan 80% of riders were subscribed customers.

### Peak Overview

This page of our story will help us see average trips count.  Three bar charts represent peak hours, days of the week and days of the month as well as the customer/ subscriber ratio. 

- Slowest times are between 12 am – 5 am, Wednesdays and Sundays.
- The busiest 7 am, between 4- 7 pm on Thursdays thru Saturdays.

### Trip Heatmaps

Heatmaps page of story as equivalent to peak overview but this one also has a breakdown of gender rides.  Just like the previous story page it shows us similar peak hours and days, additionally, male rides are significantly higher than females due to gender ratio.

### Checkout Times

Following line charts shows us number of bikes used in 60 minutes.  As we can see most of the bike’s rides did not exceed 50 minutes, the significant amount returned in first 30 min, that gives us a good idea of average ride time. Also, we provide similar line chart with additional gender breakdown.

## Summary:

Citi Bike Data of New York City of 2019 was used for this analysis. Our visualization helped us determine following patterns:

- Total rides count of a month if August is 2,344,224 
- Majority of users are subscribers
- Majority of users are male 
- Busiest days of the week are Thursdays thru Saturdays
- Slowest days of the week are Wednesdays and Sundays
- Peak hours of the day 7 am, 4-7 pm
- Slowest hours of the day 12-5 am
- Average ride time is less than 50 min

## Additional Visualization
One of the crucial aspects to consider when planning to open bike sharing business is maintenance. Foe this project we came up with additional visualization to determine what times will be best to complete bike maintenance. Here are our findings:

- As we determined earlier in out heatmaps, and bar charts best time will be Sundays thru Wednesday from 12 to 5 am.

Another additional visualization is our area graph. It helps determine what age range to focus on when promoting bike sharing business, as we can see in our graph there are almost 240k people that were born in 1968 that like to ride bikes, additionally, majority of users are 1980 thru 1998 year of birth.
